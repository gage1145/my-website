            <p> Welcome to my website! I am a data scientist and research engineer working at the intersection of biology, software, and automation. I design analytical pipelines, build reproducible tools, and turn noisy experimental data into decisions people can trust.</p>

            <p>My work spans R package development, statistical modeling, laboratory automation, and full-stack systems like LIMS platforms. I care deeply about clarity, reproducibility, and building things that actually get used — whether that’s software, protocols, or music.</p>

            <p>Additionally, I make music under the name <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/23DyBlyjDtXfYo333RBWj7">Ganymede</a>. You can find a collection of curated songs and audio projects on the Music page.</p>

            <p>This site is a collection of projects, publications, and experiments I’ve built along the way.</p>
